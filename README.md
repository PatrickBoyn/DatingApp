# DatingApp
This is a website I did a few years ago following a tutorial, where it taught full CRUD, several different design patterns.  
External API calls, and a whole host of other things that are common in projects that are bigger than I typically do on my own.
I feel like this project helped prepare me pretty well for how .Net Core does things.  
I also am amused by the fact that the idea is as social Dating App.
